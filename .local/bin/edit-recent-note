# Edit a note by referencing its UID's position in the set of UIDs (i.e., by
# how recently it was written). An argument of -1 will give the most recent
# note, an argument of -2 will give the second most recent note, and so on. An
# argument of 1 will give the oldest note, an argument of 2 will give the scond
# oldest note, and so on.
